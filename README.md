# go-github-actions-examples
Examples of GitHub Action workflows that can be used for Go and some Go Frameworks.

> **NOTE**: At this time, these workflows need to be configured from the GitHub side to deploy to App Service - the current UI in Deployment Center does not automatically create and commit any files to kick off a deployment.
